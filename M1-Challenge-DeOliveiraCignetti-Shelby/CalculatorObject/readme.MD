## Exercise 2: Calculate Object

### Requirements

- In this exercise, you will create an object that has a set of methods that does addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for two integer parameters and a separate set of methods that does the same for two double parameters.

- You will then instantiate the object and use it to perform the following calculations below.

- You must print out the calculation being performed and the result of the calculation. For example: 2 + 2 = 4.

### Instructions

Create your solution in an IntelliJ project called `CalculatorObject`.

- 1 + 1
- 23 - 52
- 34 * 2
- 12 / 3
- 12 / 7
- 3.4 + 2.3
- 6.7 * 4.4
- 5.5 - 0.5
- 10.8 / 2.2

### Exercise 2 Code: 20%
- You create a solution in an IntelliJ project called `CalculatorObject`.

- Your program prints out the calculation being performed and the result of the calculation.

    - 1 + 1
    - 23 - 52
    - 34 * 2
    - 12 / 3
    - 12 / 7
    - 3.4 + 2.3
    - 6.7 * 4.4
